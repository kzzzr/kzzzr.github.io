## Performing custom ‘not empty’ tests

dbt is shipped with essential schema tests which I covered in one of my previous posts on CORE DWH test suite. There are plenty of additional tests and handy macros shipped with the [dbt-utils](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/dbt-utils) package, including _equal_rowcount_, _expression_is_true_, _recency_, _at_least_one_, etc.

But still if you need something special you can easily add it yourself. For me this is signalling if one of my source tables is empty. I have added a simple macro which serves as a custom schema test [_test_not_empty()_](https://github.com/kzzzr/mybi-dbt-core/blob/master/macros/schema_tests.sql)_:_

{% highlight sql linenos %}
{% raw %}

-- NON_EMPTY
{% macro test_not_empty(model, column_name) %}
 
with validation as (
 
   select
       count(1) as row_count
 
   from {{ model }}
 
),
 
validation_errors as (
 
   select
       row_count
 
   from validation
   where row_count = 0
 
)
 
select count(*)
from validation_errors
 
{% endmacro %}

{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

Since it is intended to be informational only, I configure it with severity level = _warn:_

{% highlight yaml linenos %}
{% raw %}
  - name: stg_ym_sessions_facts
     tests:
       - not_empty:
           severity: warn           
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}
